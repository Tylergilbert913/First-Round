      <p>First of all, I'm a huge outdoor enthusiast. That's the first step in describing who I am, but what that means is I enjoy hiking, backpacking, rafting, mountain biking, snowboarding, skydiving, kayaking, etc. I'm basically feeling aligned when I'm outdoors. That could mean a simple walk around my city or setting up a hammock in the park. I also enjoy playing around on the guitar in my spare time, cooking for myself and friends, reading entirely too many David Baldacci novels and enjoyig live music.</p>

      <p>I originally grew up in Columbus, Ga, but moved to Savannah, Ga in 2011 and never looked back. I moved to Denver, CO in 2018 and enjoyed all it had to offer, but I'd dreamed of hiking The Appalachian Trail for at least half a decade, so I decided to move back to the south and give it a shot. Unfortunately the pandemic had other plans for me. I'm sure I'll have another opportunity to furfill this dream, but I've decided to focus on my career for the time being.</p>
